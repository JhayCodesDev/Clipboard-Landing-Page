## Overview

This is my solution to the Clipboard Landing Page challenge on Frontend Mentor
. The project is a fully responsive landing page featuring a clear hierarchy of content sections, including headers, feature descriptions, , brand logos, and a footer.

The main goals of this project were to:

Practice structuring a webpage using semantic HTML elements like header, main, section, and footer.

Implement responsive layouts using Flexbox for both simple and multi-column sections.

Apply modern typography, spacing, and color schemes to match the design.

Ensure pixel-perfect accuracy and cross-browser compatibility.

This solution demonstrates converting a design into a functional web page while honing skills in CSS layout, responsive design, and component-based HTML structure.

## My process

Analyzing the Design

Reviewed the Frontend Mentor design to understand the layout, typography, and section hierarchy.

Identified the main sections: header, content sections (s-one to s-eight), brand logos, and footer.

Setting Up the Project

Created a clean HTML structure using semantic elements: header, main, section, and footer.

Linked Google Fonts (Bai Jamjuree) for modern typography.

Prepared a base CSS file for styling and responsive layout.

Building Layouts with Flexbox

Used Flexbox to create responsive multi-column sections like .flex-con and .f-two.

Aligned images, text, and buttons to match the design accurately.

Ensured the layout adapts to different screen sizes using media queries.

Styling Text and Buttons

Set html { font-size: 62.5%; } to make calculations in rem easier (1rem = 10px).

Used rem and em units for font sizes, spacing, and margins to practice scalable, responsive design.

Applied consistent font sizes, line heights, and colors.

Styled buttons with hover effects, proper spacing, and active styling.

Added a hoverable class and cursor: pointer to indicate interactivity and improve UX.

Handling Images and Icons

Placed illustrative images for content sections and devices.

Added brand logos in .s-seven section for credibility.

Used img inside i wrappers for smaller icons where necessary.

Responsive Adjustments

Tweaked spacing, alignment, and flex properties to maintain responsiveness across mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Tested each section for pixel-perfect design accuracy.

Footer & Attribution

Built a structured footer with links and social icons.

Added attribution as required by Frontend Mentor.

Final Touches

Verified cross-browser compatibility.

Optimized CSS for readability and maintainability.

Ensured all interactive elements, images, and layouts matched the design.
